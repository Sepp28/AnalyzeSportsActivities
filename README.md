Various gymnastic exercises are recognized, classified and analyzed via video.

## Motivation
If you exercise regularly, it is desirable to have a recording of your activities. This gives you an overview of the intensity of the workouts and development of your fitness over the weeks and months. Therefore, tracking tools for running, cycling, etc. are very popular. Unfortunately, for many kinds of sports (weight training, gymnastics, etc.) there is no automatic recording option.
